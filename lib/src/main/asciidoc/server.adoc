[[representation-models]]
== Representation Models

All Spring HATEOAS representation models are rendered as JSON:API.
Consider a simple Movie class as the base for a Spring HATEOAS entity model:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/Movie.java[tags=Movie]
----

An `EntityModel.of(new Movie("1", "Star Wars"))` is then rendered as

[source, json]
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModel.json[]

In JSON:API, the `id` field must be of type `String`.
But in your model you can use any Class and `toString()` is used for conversion.
So, if the `id` attribute of `Movie` would be of type `long`,
the rendered JSON:API would be the same.
The JSON:API `type` is automatically generated of the pluralized, lower case, simple class name.
This is best practice, since then most likely the type matches the URL (end)
of the corresponding REST collection resource.

NOTE: You can configure if you want to use non-pluralized class names, see <<configuration>>

[[annotations]]
== Annotations

The goal of this implementation is to automate the mapping from/to JSON:API
as convenient as possible.

There are four new annotations provided by this project:

* `@JsonApiId` to mark a JSON:API `id`
* `@JsonApiType` to mark a field or method to provide a JSON:API `type`
* `@JsonApiTypeForClass` to mark class to provide a JSON:API `type`
** The JSON:API type is a required value of this annotation
* `@JsonApiRelationships` to mark a JSON:API `relationship`
** This annotation is not used for serialization but deserialization,
see <<Creating>> for an example.

The use of these annotations is optional. For the mapping of the `id`, the
following rules apply in order:

* the annotation `@JsonApiId` is used on a field
* the annotation `@JsonApiId` is used on a method
* the annotation `@Id` (javax.persistence.Id) is used on a field
* the annotation `@Id` (javax.persistence.Id) is used on a method
* the entity (base for representation models) provides an attribute `id`

For the mapping of the `type`, the
following rules apply in order:

* the annotation `@JsonApiTypeForClass` is used on a class
* the annotation `@JsonApiType` is used on a field
* the annotation `@JsonApiType` is used on a method
* if no annotation is present, the pluralized, lower case, simple class name of the entity will be used

NOTE: You can configure if you want to use non-pluralized class names, see <<configuration>>

As an example, consider the class

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithAnnotations.java[tags=Movie]
----

Then, `EntityModel.of(new Movie2("1", "Star Wars", "my-movies")))` will be rendered as

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithAnnotations.json[]
----


== JSON:API Builder

If you want to use JSON:API `relationships` or `included` data, you can use the
`JsonApiModelBuilder`. The following example shows how to create a JSON::API representation model using the `JsonApiModelBuilder`
[source, java]
----
import static com.toedter.spring.hateoas.jsonapi.JsonApiModelBuilder.jsonApiModel;
----

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=build-movie-model]
----

Consider that you want to express the relationships of movies to their directors.
A simple `Director` class could look like:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/Director.java[tags=Director]
----

You can build a relationship from a movie to a director like

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=build-relationship]
----

The representation model will be rendered as
[source, json, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieJsonApiModelWithRelationship.json[]
----

If you want the `directors` relationship always being rendered as an array,
even if it is empty or contains only a single data element,
you can build it like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=single-collection-relationship]
----

The representation model will be rendered as
[source, json, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieWithSingleCollectionRelationship.json[]
----

You can also pass a Java `Collection` as data for a relationship.
A collection will always be rendered as JSON array,
even when it is empty or contains a single element.
So,

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=single-collection-relationship2]
----

would be rendered exactly like the previous example.

The builder also provides methods for adding links and meta to a relationship.
Check out the link:../api/com/toedter/spring/hateoas/jsonapi/JsonApiModelBuilder.html[Javadoc API documentation]
for more details.

If you want to include the related resources in the JSON:API output,
you can build included `director` resources like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=build-included]
----

The representation model will be rendered as
[source, json, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieJsonApiModelWithManyRelationshipsAndIncluded.json[]
----

The following example shows the creation of a more complex
JSON:API specific representation model with a paged model as the base.
The builder supports adding both pagination metadata and pagination links.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=complex-paged-model]
----

This model will be rendered as

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/moviesPagedJsonApiModelWithIncluded.json[]
----

[[inclusion]]
== Inclusion of related Resources

There is no direct support for automatically including related resources,
but a REST controller could provide an optional request parameter like

[source, java]
@RequestParam(value = "included", required = false) String[] included)

Then, within the controller implementation, this parameter could be interpreted,
and the builder could be used for the inclusion, like

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-code-dir}/movie/MovieController.java[tags=relationship-inclusion]
----

Duplicated included directors will be eliminated automatically.

[[Nesting]]
== Nesting of JsonApiModels

When using the model builder, ``JsonApiModel`` instances can be used as the model and included
resources. Here is an example that also illustrates the different levels of meta.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=nesting]
----

This model will be rendered as

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieWithAllMetaLevels.json[]
----

[[sparse-fielsets]]
== Sparse Fieldsets

Sparse fieldsets are supported for attributes within `data` and `included`. You can add sparse fieldsets
by using the `JsonApiBuilder`. The following example illustrates the build, assuming a director would have
the attributes `name` and `born`, and a movie would have the attributes `title` and `rating`.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=sparse-fieldset]
----

So, only the name attribute of a director, and the title attribute
of a movie would be serialized:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/directorWithSparseFieldsetOnIncluded.json[]
----

In a REST controller, a method with HTTP-mapping could provide an optional request attribute for each sparse fieldset
that should be applied to a specific JSON:API type, like:

[source, java]
@RequestParam(value = "fields[movies]", required = false) String[] fieldsMovies,
@RequestParam(value = "fields[directors]", required = false) String[] fieldsDirectors)

In the following controller code, you could check the existence of these request parameters, like:

[source, java]
if (fieldsDirectors != null) {
    builder = builder.fields("directors", fieldsDirectors);
}

When adding sparse fieldsets to the builder, they will NOT automatically exclude added relationships.
Relationships have to be added conditionally, like the inclusions, for example:

[source, java]
if (fieldsDirectors = null || Arrays.asList(fieldsDirectors).contains("movies")) {
    builder = builder.relationship("movies", director.getMovies());
}

[[Creating]]
== Creating Resources with HTTP POST

To create new REST resources using HTTP POST, you can provide `JSON:API` formatted JSON as input.
For example, a `POST` with the body:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovie.json[]
----

will be deserialized to an `EntityModel<Movie>` automatically.
You can also create REST resources that contain `JSON:API relationships`.
You just have to annotate the underlying domain model class, with `JsonApiRelationships(<relationship name>)`

For example, a `POST` with the body:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithTwoRelationships.json[]
----

will be deserialized to an `EntityModel<Movie>` with a filled list of directors,
where ONLY the id attribute of each director is set.
The REST controller then has to interpret those relationships and bind the
real director objects to the movie.

Here is an example of a class using the annotation:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithDirectors.java[tags=Movie-with-directors]
----

NOTE: If you use the annotation `JsonApiRelationships` on an attribute of a Java class,
the content will NOT be serialized automatically to `JSON:API relationships`. This is on purpose,
please use the `JsonApiModelBuilder` to decide, which relationships and included objects you want to return.

[[server-deserialization]]
== Deserialization of JSON:API types ==

If entities contain an explicit `@JsonApiType` field annotation,
those fields are also filled during deserialization.
This is also true for relationships if the relationship entity contains an explicit `@JsonApiType`
annotation.

Consider the following classes:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/DirectorWithType.java[tags=director-with-type]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithTypedDirectors.java[tags=movie-with-typed-director]
----

Then the following JSON

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithTwoRelationshipsWithDifferentTypes.json[]
----

will be deserialized to a `MovieWithTypedDirectors` where myType is "movies"
and 2 (empty) `DirectorWithType` objects.
The first `DirectorWithType` object with id = '1' and directorType = "director-type-1",
the second `DirectorWithType` object with id = '2' and directorType = "director-type-2",

NOTE: Currently, only `List` and `Set` are supported collection classes.

[[polymorphy]]
== Polymorphic Deserialization ==

The easiest way for polymorphic deserialization is to use the JsonApiConfiguration for
assigning a JSON:API type to a Java class and then also switching on, that the mappings should
also be used for deserialization, e.g.

[source, Java]
@Bean
JsonApiConfiguration jsonApiConfiguration() {
    return new JsonApiConfiguration()
            .withTypeForClass(MovieSubclass.class, "my-movies")
            .withTypeForClassUsedForDeserialization(true));
}

Then a POST to a controller method like
[source, java]
@PostMapping("/movies")
public ResponseEntity<?> newMovie(@RequestBody EntityModel<Movie> movie) { ...

with JSON like
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithCustomType.json[]
----

would be deserialized to a Java class of type `MovieSubclass`. Be aware that this mechanism overrides
the default deserialization to an object of the class given by the REST controller method's signature. So, if the controller accepts an
`EntityModel<Movie>`, you could potentially post a JSON that the creates an `EntityModel<Director>` and
enters the controller's method with it. Then your implementation has to take care of those cases and probably might throw a class cast exception.

The same mechanism can also be used to deserialize polymorphic relationships.

Consider the following class:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithDirectors.java[tags=Movie-with-directors]
----

and a `JsonApiConfiguration` that looks like
[source, Java]
@Bean
JsonApiConfiguration jsonApiConfiguration() {
    return new JsonApiConfiguration()
        .withTypeForClass(DirectorWithEmail.class,  "directors-with-email")
        .withTypeForClassUsedForDeserialization(true));
}

Then an HTTP POST to /movies with body
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithTwoRelationshipsWithPolymorphicTypes.json[]
----

would create 2 directors in the `directors` list, both empty except for the `id` field.
But the first director would be an instance of class `Director`,
while the second director would be an instance of class `DirectorWithEmail`.

=== Jackson Annotations ===

If the above mechanism does not fit your needs,
you can also configure polymorphic deserialization
on a 'per class' base, using some Jackson annotations. The following example illustrates this:

Imagine a controller method like
[source, java]
@PostMapping("/movies")
public ResponseEntity<?> newMovie(@RequestBody EntityModel<Movie> movie) { ...

and a subclass of `Movie` that contains a rating, like
[source, java]
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
@JsonApiTypeForClass("movies")
public class MovieWithRating extends Movie {
    private double rating;
}

You could now annotate the `Movie` class with:
[source, java]
@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME)
@JsonSubTypes({
    @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = MovieWithRating.class, name = "movieWithRating")
})

Then an HTTP POST to /movies with body
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/polymorphicMovie.json[]
----

would be deserialized to an object of class `MovieWithRating`, even though the controller method accepts the superclass `Movie`.

NOTE: @-members will be introduced in JSON:API version 1.1.
The above example will produce JSON that is not compliant with JSON:API 1.0.
For JSON:API 1.0 compliance you could configure Jackson like
`@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, property = "typeName")` instead.
From the JSON:API 1.1 spec:
...because @-Members must be ignored when interpreting that definition,
an @-Member that occurs in an attributes object is not an attribute.

Important: The above mechanism is also used for serialization, so you could set
the JSON:API `type` attribute (within data) to a more generic type, but still serialize the
`@type` attribute to indicate the specialized type.
So the JSON of the serialized Java object (of class `MovieWithRating`) would then look like:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/polymorphicMovie.json[]
----

It is also possible to use Jackson's `@JsonSubTypes` annotation for polymorphic relationships.
Here is an example:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/polymorphism/PolymorphicRelationEntity.java[tags=PolymorphicRelationEntity]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/polymorphism/SuperEntity.java[tags=SuperEntity]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/polymorphism/SuperEChild.java[tags=SuperEChild]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/polymorphism/SuperEChild2.java[tags=SuperEChild2]
----

Then a JSON like

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/polymorphicRelationships.json[]
----

would be deserialized to a `PolymorphicRelationEntity` with 2 relationships,
the first one of Class `SuperEChild`, the second one of class `SuperEChild2`.

NOTE: Right now there is the restriction, that the type attribute of both
`SuperEChild` and `SuperEChild2` has to be `type`. E.g. `_type` would not work.

[[error-handling]]
== Error Handling

To create `JSON:API` compliant error messages, you can use `JsonApiErrors` and `JsonApiError`

Here is an example of how to produce an error response:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/WebMvcMovieController.java[tags=errors-builder]
----

The result would be rendered as:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/errorsMvcExample.json[]
----
