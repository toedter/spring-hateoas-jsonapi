[[representation-models]]
== Representation Models

All Spring HATEOAS representation models are rendered as JSON:API.
Consider a simple Movie class as the base for a Spring HATEOAS entity model:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/Movie.java[tags=Movie]
----

An `EntityModel.of(new Movie("1", "Star Wars"))` is then rendered as

[source, json]
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModel.json[]

In JSON:API, the `id` field must be of type `String`.
However, in your model you can use any class, and `toString()` is used for conversion.
So, if the `id` attribute of `Movie` were of type `long`,
the rendered JSON:API output would be the same.
The JSON:API `type` is automatically generated from the pluralized, lowercase, simple class name.
This is a best practice, as the type will most likely match the URL (endpoint)
of the corresponding REST collection resource.

NOTE: You can configure if you want to use non-pluralized class names, see <<configuration>>

[[links]]
== Links

If Spring HATEOAS links contain only an href, the simple JSON:API link format is used for rendering.
Here is an example of a simple self link:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithLinks.json[]
----

A complex Link object in Spring HATEOAS can have optional properties like name, type, hreflang, title, and others.
In previous versions of this library, those properties were serialized as JSON:API link metadata, e.g.

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithComplexLinkAndJsonapi10Meta.json[]
----

JSON:API 1.1 now defines the optional link properties type, title, and hreflang, see link:++https://jsonapi.org/format/#auto-id--link-objects++[JSON:API Link Objects].
The default rendering of a complex link is now

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithComplexLink.json[]
----

As you can see, the properties title, type, and hreflang now appear only as top-level link properties.
The new format reflects the JSON:API 1.1 link structure,
but is _not_ backward compatible with version 1.x.x of this library.

If you want to maintain backward compatibility and render the link properties type, title, and hreflang
both as top-level link properties _and_ in the meta section, you can configure this behavior
(see <<links-configuration>>). The rendered result would then look like:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithComplexLinkAndOldMeta.json[]
----

JSON:API is very strict about the allowed link relations, the allowed
https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-top-level[top-level links] are
`self`, `related`, `describedBy`, `next`, `prev`, `first` and `last`. The only allowed
https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-links[resource link] is `self`.

By default, all other links will _not_ be serialized. If you want to serialize links that are non-compliant
with JSON:API, you can use a specific configuration, (see <<links-configuration>>).

[[link-placement]]
== Link Placement

The JSON:API specification allows links to be placed at two different levels in the document:

* **Document level (top-level)** - Links appear at the top level of the JSON document (default behavior)
* **Resource level** - Links appear inside the resource object within the "data" section

By default, this library places links at the document level for single resource (EntityModel) serialization.
However, you can configure this behavior using the `LinksAtResourceLevel` configuration option
(see <<links-placement-configuration>>).

=== Document Level Links (Default)

When using the default configuration, links from an EntityModel are placed at the document level:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Movie movie = new Movie("1", "Star Wars");
EntityModel<Movie> entityModel = EntityModel.of(movie);
entityModel.add(Link.of("http://localhost/movies/1").withSelfRel());
----

This produces the following JSON:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithLinksAtDocumentLevel.json[]
----

=== Resource Level Links

To place links at the resource level instead, configure `LinksAtResourceLevel` to `true` (See <<link-placement-configuration-example>>):

[source, java, indent=0]
----
Movie movie = new Movie("1", "Star Wars");
EntityModel<Movie> entityModel = EntityModel.of(movie);
entityModel.add(Link.of("http://localhost/movies/1").withSelfRel());
----

This produces the following JSON:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithLinksAtResourceLevel.json[]
----

NOTE: This configuration only affects single resource (EntityModel) serialization. Collection models (CollectionModel)
and paged models (PagedModel) are not affected by this setting.

Both approaches are valid according to the JSON:API specification. Choose the approach that best fits your API design:

* **Document level** - Common pattern, provides clear separation between document metadata and resource data
* **Resource level** - Keeps all resource-related information co-located, which some API consumers may prefer

[[annotations]]
== Annotations

The goal of this implementation is to automate the mapping to/from JSON:API
as conveniently as possible.

This project provides four annotations:

* `@JsonApiId` to mark a JSON:API `id`
* `@JsonApiType` to mark a field or method to provide a JSON:API `type`
* `@JsonApiTypeForClass` to mark class to provide a JSON:API `type`
** The JSON:API type is a required value of this annotation
* `@JsonApiRelationships` to mark a JSON:API `relationship`
** This annotation is not used for serialization but deserialization,
see <<Creating>> for an example.
* `@JsonApiMeta` to mark a field or method to provide a JSON:API `meta` information
** This annotation works for serialization and deserialization.

The use of these annotations is optional. For the mapping of the `id`, the
following rules apply in order:

* the annotation `@JsonApiId` is used on a field
* the annotation `@JsonApiId` is used on a method
* the annotation `@Id` (jakarta.persistence.Id) or `@EmbeddedId` (jakarta.persistence.EmbeddedId) is used on a field
* the annotation `@Id` (jakarta.persistence.Id) or `@EmbeddedId` (jakarta.persistence.EmbeddedId) is used on a method
* the entity (base for representation models) provides an attribute `id`

For the mapping of the `type`, the
following rules apply in order:

* the annotation `@JsonApiTypeForClass` is used on a class
* the annotation `@JsonApiType` is used on a field
* the annotation `@JsonApiType` is used on a method
* if no annotation is present, the pluralized, lower case, simple class name of the entity will be used

NOTE: You can configure if you want to use non-pluralized class names, see <<configuration>>

As an example, consider the class

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithAnnotations.java[tags=Movie]
----

Then, `EntityModel.of(new MovieWithAnnotations("1", "my-movies", "metaValue", "Star Wars")))` will be rendered as

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieEntityModelWithThreeAnnotations.json[]
----


== JSON:API Builder

If you want to use JSON:API `relationships` or `included` data, you can use the
`JsonApiModelBuilder`. The following example shows how to create a JSON:API representation model using the `JsonApiModelBuilder`:
[source, java]
----
import static com.toedter.spring.hateoas.jsonapi.JsonApiModelBuilder.jsonApiModel;
----

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=build-movie-model]
----

Consider that you want to express the relationships of movies to their directors.
A simple `Director` class could look like:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/Director.java[tags=Director]
----

You can build a relationship from a movie to a director like

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=build-relationship]
----

The representation model will be rendered as
[source, json, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieJsonApiModelWithRelationship.json[]
----

If you want the `directors` relationship to always be rendered as an array,
even if it is empty or contains only a single data element,
you can build it like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=single-collection-relationship]
----

The representation model will be rendered as
[source, json, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieWithSingleCollectionRelationship.json[]
----

You can also pass a Java `Collection` as data for a relationship.
A collection will always be rendered as a JSON array,
even when it is empty or contains a single element.
So,

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=single-collection-relationship2]
----

would be rendered exactly like the previous example.

The builder also provides methods for adding links and meta to a relationship.
Check out the link:../api/com/toedter/spring/hateoas/jsonapi/JsonApiModelBuilder.html[Javadoc API documentation]
for more details.

If you want to include the related resources in the JSON:API output,
you can build included `director` resources like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=build-included]
----

The representation model will be rendered as
[source, json, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieJsonApiModelWithManyRelationshipsAndIncluded.json[]
----

The following example shows the creation of a more complex
JSON:API specific representation model with a paged model as the base.
The builder supports adding both pagination metadata and pagination links.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=complex-paged-model]
----

This model will be rendered as

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/moviesPagedJsonApiModelWithIncluded.json[]
----

=== Explicit Configuration of Empty Relationships

The JSON:API specification allows empty to-one relationships and empty to-many relationships
(see link:https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-linkage[JSON:API specification]).

For more explicit control over the serialization of empty relationships, you can use
`relationshipWithNullData()` to create an empty to-one relationship (serialized as `"data": null`)
or `relationshipWithEmptyData()` to create an empty to-many relationship (serialized as `"data": []`).

An explicit empty to-one relationship can be added like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=explicit-null-relationship]
----

This will produce `"data": null` in the relationship object, representing an empty to-one relationship.

An explicit empty to-many relationship can be added like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=explicit-empty-relationship]
----

This will produce `"data": []` in the relationship object, representing an empty to-many relationship.

These methods are particularly useful when you want to replace existing relationship data with null or an empty array,
or when you need to explicitly indicate the type of empty relationship (to-one vs. to-many) for your JSON:API consumers.
These methods also preserve any existing links and meta information in the relationship.

[[inclusion]]
== Inclusion of Related Resources

There is no direct support for automatically including related resources,
but a REST controller can provide an optional request parameter like:

[source, java]
@RequestParam(value = "include", required = false) String[] include

Then, within the controller implementation, this parameter can be interpreted,
and the builder can be used for the inclusion, like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-code-dir}/movie/MovieController.java[tags=relationship-inclusion]
----

Duplicated included directors will be eliminated automatically.

[[Nesting]]
== Nesting of JsonApiModels

When using the model builder, ``JsonApiModel`` instances can be used as the model and included
resources. Here is an example that also illustrates the different levels of meta.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=nesting]
----

This model will be rendered as

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieWithAllMetaLevels.json[]
----

[[sparse-fielsets]]
== Sparse Fieldsets

Sparse fieldsets are supported for attributes within `data` and `included`. You can add sparse fieldsets
using the `JsonApiBuilder`. The following example illustrates the build, assuming a director has
the attributes `name` and `born`, and a movie has the attributes `title` and `rating`.

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/JsonApiModelBuilderIntegrationTest.java[tags=sparse-fieldset]
----

So, only the name attribute of a director, and the title attribute
of a movie would be serialized:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/directorWithSparseFieldsetOnIncluded.json[]
----

In a REST controller, a method with HTTP-mapping can provide an optional request parameter for each sparse fieldset
that should be applied to a specific JSON:API type, like:

[source, java]
@RequestParam(value = "fields[movies]", required = false) String[] fieldsMovies,
@RequestParam(value = "fields[directors]", required = false) String[] fieldsDirectors)

In the following controller code, you could check the existence of these request parameters, like:

[source, java]
if (fieldsDirectors != null) {
    builder = builder.fields("directors", fieldsDirectors);
}

When adding sparse fieldsets to the builder, they will NOT automatically exclude added relationships.
Relationships have to be added conditionally, like the inclusions, for example:

[source, java]
if (fieldsDirectors = null || Arrays.asList(fieldsDirectors).contains("movies")) {
    builder = builder.relationship("movies", director.getMovies());
}

[[affordances]]
== Spring HATEOAS Affordances

Spring HATEOAS provides a generic, media type-independent API for
{spring-hateoas-version}/reference/html/#server.affordances[affordances].
In the JSON:API specification, there is no equivalent concept, but JSON:API allows links to have additional meta
information. This library provides a new *experimental* configuration to render Spring HATEOAS affordances as
JSON:API link meta. Currently, a proprietary format is supported as well as the HAL-FORMS template format,
which can be serialized by Spring HATEOAS out of the box.

The following example shows the usage of Spring HATEOAS affordances.
First, you need to enable this experimental feature in the configuration, like:

[source, Java]
new JsonApiConfiguration().withAffordancesRenderedAsLinkMeta(
   JsonApiConfiguration.AffordanceType.SPRING_HATEOAS);

Then you can add an affordance (for creating a movie) to a Spring HATEOAS link like:

[source, java, , indent=0]
----
include::{example-code-dir}/movie/MovieController.java[tags=affordance]
----

The rendered result of the self link would then be

[source, json]
"links": {
  "self": {
    "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/movies?page[number]=0&page[size]=10",
    "meta": {
      "affordances": [
        {
          "name": "newMovie",
          "link": {
            "rel": "newMovie",
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/movies"
          },
          "httpMethod": "POST",
          "inputProperties": [
            {
              "name": "imdbId",
              "type": "text",
            },
            {
              "name": "rank",
              "type": "number",
            },
            {
              "name": "rating",
              "type": "number",
            },
            {
              "name": "title",
              "type": "text",
              "required": true
            },
            {
              "name": "year",
              "type": "number",
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

IMPORTANT: This feature is experimental. The JSON structure of the provided affordances might have breaking changes in upcoming releases.

NOTE: To obtain property information such as required fields, you must include a dependency on `javax.validation:validation-api` and annotate the required fields with `@NotNull`.

[[Creating]]
== Creating Resources with HTTP POST

To create new REST resources using HTTP POST, you can provide `JSON:API` formatted JSON as input.
For example, a `POST` with the body:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovie.json[]
----

will be deserialized to an `EntityModel<Movie>` automatically.
You can also create REST resources that contain `JSON:API relationships`.
You simply need to annotate the underlying domain model class with `JsonApiRelationships(<relationship name>)`.

For example, a `POST` with the body:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithTwoRelationships.json[]
----

will be deserialized to an `EntityModel<Movie>` with a filled list of directors,
where only the id attribute of each director is set.
The REST controller must then interpret those relationships and bind the
real director objects to the movie.

Here is an example of a class using the annotation:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithDirectors.java[tags=Movie-with-directors]
----

If you want to set the attributes of a related director,
you could put the director resource in the included section of the JSON, like

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieWithIncludedRelationships.json[]
----

In this case, after deserialization the `name` attribute of the first director is set to "George Lucas".

NOTE: If you use the annotation `JsonApiRelationships` on an attribute of a Java class,
the content will NOT be serialized automatically to `JSON:API relationships`. This is on purpose,
please use the `JsonApiModelBuilder` to decide, which relationships and included objects you want to return.

[[server-deserialization]]
== Deserialization of JSON:API Types

If entities contain an explicit `@JsonApiType` field annotation,
those fields are also filled during deserialization.
This is also true for relationships if the relationship entity contains an explicit `@JsonApiType`
annotation.

Consider the following classes:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/DirectorWithType.java[tags=director-with-type]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithTypedDirectors.java[tags=movie-with-typed-director]
----

Then the following JSON

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithTwoRelationshipsWithDifferentTypes.json[]
----

will be deserialized to a `MovieWithTypedDirectors` where myType is "movies"
and 2 (empty) `DirectorWithType` objects.
The first `DirectorWithType` object with id = '1' and directorType = "director-type-1",
the second `DirectorWithType` object with id = '2' and directorType = "director-type-2",

NOTE: Currently, only `List` and `Set` are supported collection classes.

[[collection-model-deserialization]]
== Deserialization of PagedModels

While a server implementation of HTTP POST and PATCH takes single resources as input,
it is sometimes useful to be able to deserialize collection models and paged models. This is
helpful when a service consumes results from other services that produce JSON:API responses.

Here is an example of a serialized `PagedModel`.

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/moviesPagedModelWithEntityLinks.json[]
----

If you deserialize the above JSON to a `PagedModel<EntityModel<Movie>>>`: The page meta information will be deserialized, as well as the links in both movie entity models.
The same mechanism would work also for `CollectionModel<EntityModel<Movie>>>`.

[[uuid]]
== UUID Deserialization

UUIDs (`java.util.UUID`) are supported natively for deserialization.
So a JSON like

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/movieWithUUID.json[]
----

would be correctly deserialized to an object of class

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithUUID.java[tags=movie-with-uuid]
----

[[polymorphy]]
== Polymorphic Deserialization

The easiest way for polymorphic deserialization is to use the JsonApiConfiguration to
assign a JSON:API type to a Java class and then also enable the mappings to be
used for deserialization, e.g.

[source, Java]
@Bean
JsonApiConfiguration jsonApiConfiguration() {
    return new JsonApiConfiguration()
            .withTypeForClass(MovieSubclass.class, "my-movies")
            .withTypeForClassUsedForDeserialization(true));
}

Then a POST to a controller method like
[source, java]
@PostMapping("/movies")
public ResponseEntity<?> newMovie(@RequestBody EntityModel<Movie> movie) { ...

with JSON like
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithCustomType.json[]
----

would be deserialized to a Java class of type `MovieSubclass`. Note that this mechanism overrides
the default deserialization to an object of the class given by the REST controller method's signature.
The deserializer checks if the mapped Java type is assignable to the originally required Java type;
otherwise, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

The same mechanism can also be used to deserialize polymorphic relationships.

Consider the following class:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/MovieWithDirectors.java[tags=Movie-with-directors]
----

and a `JsonApiConfiguration` that looks like
[source, Java]
@Bean
JsonApiConfiguration jsonApiConfiguration() {
    return new JsonApiConfiguration()
        .withTypeForClass(DirectorWithEmail.class,  "directors-with-email")
        .withTypeForClassUsedForDeserialization(true));
}

Then an HTTP POST to /movies with body
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithTwoRelationshipsWithPolymorphicTypes.json[]
----

would create 2 directors in the `directors` list, both empty except for the `id` field.
But the first director would be an instance of class `Director`,
while the second director would be an instance of class `DirectorWithEmail`.

=== Jackson Annotations

If the above mechanism does not fit your needs,
you can also configure polymorphic deserialization
on a per-class basis using Jackson annotations. The following example illustrates this:

Imagine a controller method like
[source, java]
@PostMapping("/movies")
public ResponseEntity<?> newMovie(@RequestBody EntityModel<Movie> movie) { ...

and a subclass of `Movie` that contains a rating, like
[source, java]
@NoArgsConstructor
@Data
@JsonApiTypeForClass("movies")
public class MovieWithRating extends Movie {
    private double rating;
}

You could now annotate the `Movie` class with:
[source, java]
@JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME)
@JsonSubTypes({
    @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = MovieWithRating.class, name = "movieWithRating")
})

Then an HTTP POST to /movies with body
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/postMovieWithRating.json[]
----

would be deserialized to an object of class `MovieWithRating`, even though the controller method accepts the superclass `Movie`.

NOTE: @-Members were introduced in JSON:API version 1.1, see https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-member-names-at-members.
From the JSON:API 1.1 spec:
...an @-Member that occurs in an attributes object is not an attribute.

Important: The above mechanism is also used for serialization, so you can set
the JSON:API `type` attribute (within data) to a more generic type while still serializing the
`@type` attribute to indicate the specialized type.
The JSON of the serialized Java object (of class `MovieWithRating`) would then look like:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/polymorphicMovie.json[]
----

It is also possible to use Jackson's `@JsonSubTypes` annotation for polymorphic relationships.
Here is an example:

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/polymorphism/PolymorphicRelationEntity.java[tags=PolymorphicRelationEntity]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/polymorphism/SuperEntity.java[tags=SuperEntity]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/polymorphism/SuperEChild.java[tags=SuperEChild]
----

[source, java]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/polymorphism/SuperEChild2.java[tags=SuperEChild2]
----

Then a JSON like

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/polymorphicRelationships.json[]
----

would be deserialized to a `PolymorphicRelationEntity` with 2 relationships,
the first one of Class `SuperEChild`, the second one of class `SuperEChild2`.

NOTE: Currently, there is a restriction that the type attribute of both
`SuperEChild` and `SuperEChild2` must be `type`. For example, `_type` would not work.

[[error-handling]]
== Error Handling

To create `JSON:API` compliant error messages, you can use `JsonApiErrors` and `JsonApiError`

Here is an example of how to produce an error response:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{test-dir}/support/WebMvcMovieController.java[tags=errors-builder]
----

The result would be rendered as:

[source, json]
----
include::{test-resources-dir}/errorsMvcExample.json[]
----

=== More Generic Error Handling

If you want to implement more generic error handling that converts exceptions
to JSON:API error responses, you can implement a `@ControllerAdvice` like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-code-dir}/exception/ExceptionControllerAdvice.java[tags=exception-controller-advice]
----

This would then convert exceptions to JSON:API error responses like:

[source, json]
----
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "id": "58bab604-a149-452a-ab30-f61fafab80e7",
            "status": "500",
            "code": "xrn:err:platform:internalServerError",
            "title": "Internal server error",
            "detail": "JSON parse error: Illegal unquoted character ((CTRL-CHAR, code 13)): has to be escaped using backslash to be included in string value"
        }
    ]
}
----

Furthermore, you can implement a `JsonApiErrorsException` like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-code-dir}/exception/JsonApiErrorsException.java[tags=jsonapi-errors-exception]
----

and provide `CommonErrors` like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-code-dir}/exception/CommonErrors.java[tags=common-errors]
----

Now you can throw a `JsonApiErrorsException` like:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-code-dir}/movie/MovieController.java[tags=throw-common-error-exception]
----

which would then be converted to a JSON:API error response.

You can find implementations of the `ExceptionControllerAdvice`, `JsonApiErrorsException`, and `CommonErrors` in the example code.

[[configuration]]
